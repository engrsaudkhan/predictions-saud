This Graphical User Interface for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for predicting mechanical properties of metakolin-based soilcrete materials is developed by Muhammad Saud Khan from Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada, Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad and Department of Civil Engineering, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology with the equal contribution of:
1) Zohaib Mehmood from Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, and 
2) Waleed Bin Inqiad from Department of Structural Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology.

Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.
1) Python must be installed.
2) relevant libraries must be installed including, for user ease import following libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from math import pow, sqrt
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
class RangeInputGUI:
-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Run it in IDEs such as VS code, Jupyter notebook, Anaconda, Spyder, etc.
3) Load code.


Tips to run code.
1) Install all libraries
2) Make sure all files uploaded here are contained in relevant folder
3) Just run the code.
4) Using scroll adjust input values
5) Click on predict under model (click on relevant property to be predicted)
6) See output
9) Change values and repeat the process from 2 to 6
